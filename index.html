                    <h2>Tech Volunteer Opportunities for Women in Seattle:</h2>
                    <p>The gender gap in the technology industry is not a secret, but what can we do about it? Could volunteer opportunities open more doors for women in the field? And through them, can we keep more women interested in staying?</p>
                    <p>Women in the technology field are in short supply, many of them leave after only a year. There have been many studies on the factors that led us to this point. However, the solution to this problem remains to be found. "In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%" (Girls Who Code).</p>
                    <p>Volunteering creates a community and provides a safe place for women to communicate with each other, support one another, and encourage the next generation. Itâ€™s a way to stem the loneliness that can come from not being around people that think similarly to them or have a comparative perspective. Women could have a better chance of entering and staying in the tech industry if they are provided better social resources.</p>
