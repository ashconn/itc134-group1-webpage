The Impact of Tech Volunteer Opportunities for Women in Seattle on the Community:

Creating a community of women in technology could alter the future of the industry. Via time and relationship, a network of support and inspiration can pave the way for more women entering and staying in the field. Volunteering will dispel the feeling of solitude and remind individuals that they are not in this alone. “Communities are built by strong leaders who want to make a difference,” (ChickTech).

The current generation of women in tech can support one another through volunteer opportunities. A lot of important information about the industry is shared in “non-professional” settings. Having a safe place outside of the workplace to learn can help women not feel isolated in their struggles.

The next generation of women in tech needs to learn from the current generation. Face-to-face volunteering and mentorship provide much-needed examples of successful women in science. “Chatting to the girls about what you do helps normalize the idea that women do science, and helps them understand exactly what kind of tasks and jobs that can involve,” (GEMS).
