The Impact of Tech Volunteers Opportunities for Women in Seattle on the Tech Industry:

Expanding professional circles via networking (caused by volunteering and meet-ups) lead to a greater number of women in the talent pool. Companies have more options and specializations to choose from to fill their needs. Good, old-fashioned networking in an environment that is away from the 9-to-5 atmosphere also creates an atmosphere of creativity. These workers can then return to work with new ideas to implement.

With greater social support and resources, women are more likely to stay and lead to teams with greater diversity. The positive impacts of diversity in a team cannot be overstated. When everyone looking at a problem comes at it with the same background and point of view, there is little room for collaboration. “Diverse teams produce better results!” (She’s Coding).
