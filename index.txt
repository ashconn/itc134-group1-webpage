Tech Volunteer Opportunities for Women in Seattle:

The gender gap in the technology industry is not a secret, but what can we do about it? Could volunteer opportunities open more doors for women in the field? And through them, can we keep more women interested in staying?

Women in the technology field are in short supply, many of them leave after only a year. There have been many studies on the factors that led us to this point. However, the solution to this problem remains to be found. "In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%" (Girls Who Code).

Volunteering creates a community and provides a safe place for women to communicate with each other, support one another, and encourage the next generation. Itâ€™s a way to stem the loneliness that can come from not being around people that think similarly to them or have a comparative perspective. Women could have a better chance of entering and staying in the tech industry if they are provided better social resources.
