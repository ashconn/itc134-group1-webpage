            <h2>The Impact of Tech Volunteer Opportunities for Women in Seattle on the Community:</h2>
            <p>Creating a community of women in technology could alter the future of the industry. Via time and
                relationship, a network of support and inspiration can pave the way for more women entering and staying
                in the field. Volunteering will dispel the feeling of solitude and remind individuals that they are not
                in this alone. “Communities are built by strong leaders who want to make a difference,” (ChickTech).</p>
            <p>The current generation of women in tech can support one another through volunteer opportunities. A lot of
                important information about the industry is shared in “non-professional” settings. Having a safe place
                outside of the workplace to learn can help women not feel isolated in their struggles.</p>
            <p>The next generation of women in tech needs to learn from the current generation. Face-to-face
                volunteering and mentorship provide much-needed examples of successful women in science. “Chatting to
                the girls about what you do helps normalize the idea that women do science, and helps them understand
                exactly what kind of tasks and jobs that can involve,” (GEMS).</p>
