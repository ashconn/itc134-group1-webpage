                        <h2>The Impact of Tech Volunteers Opportunities for Women in Seattle on the Tech Industry:</h2>
                        <p>Expanding professional circles via networking (caused by volunteering and meet-ups) lead to a greater number of women in the talent pool. Companies have more options and specializations to choose from to fill their needs. Good, old-fashioned networking in an environment that is away from the 9-to-5 atmosphere also creates an atmosphere of creativity. These workers can then return to work with new ideas to implement.</p>
                        <p>With greater social support and resources, women are more likely to stay and lead to teams with greater diversity. The positive impacts of diversity in a team cannot be overstated. When everyone looking at a problem comes at it with the same background and point of view, there is little room for collaboration. “Diverse teams produce better results!” (She’s Coding).</p>
